Skeleton 
========================================

This is a test library.

Installation via composer
-------------

1. [Add current repository to composer.json](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#vcs)
2. Require library: `composer require "dredger/skeleton1"`

or `php701  composer.phar require  dredger/skeleton1`

Usage
-------

Open [functional test](tests/Functional/HelloTest.php) for example of usage

Recommendation
-------------
If you can use Dependency Container  just use it. For example for symfony2
```yaml
# app/config/services.yml
services:
    guzzle_client:
        class:        
    qr.google_renderer:
        class:        
        arguments:    
    qr.generator:
        class:        
        arguments:    
```

And you will be able to use it:  
```php
class HelloController extends Controller
{
    // ...

    public function hello()
    {
       
    }
}
```
